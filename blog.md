## Why 2048 in the Cloud?

The 2048 game might seem like an unlikely candidate for a full AWS deployment, but that's exactly what makes it perfect for learning. By taking something simple and applying enterprise-grade AWS services, we can focus on the DevOps patterns without getting lost in complex application logic.

This project demonstrates how AWS services work together to create a robust, scalable, and secure deployment pipeline that you can apply to any application.

## AWS Architecture Overview

Our cloud-native 2048 game leverages these AWS services:

- üèóÔ∏è **Amazon EKS** - Managed Kubernetes for container orchestration
- üì¶ **Amazon ECR** - Private container registry for our Docker images
- üîÑ **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline with AWS integration
- üéØ **ArgoCD on EKS** - GitOps deployment automation
- üîí **AWS IAM** - Security and access management
- üåê **Application Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution and SSL termination
- üìä **CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging (ready for integration)

## Step 1: Containerizing for AWS ECR

First, we containerize our 2048 game for deployment to Amazon ECR. Since it's a static JavaScript application, nginx:alpine provides the perfect lightweight foundation:

```dockerfile
# Use nginx alpine for smaller image size
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the game files to nginx html directory
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Remove unnecessary files from the container
RUN rm -f /usr/share/nginx/html/Dockerfile \
    /usr/share/nginx/html/README.md \
    # ... other cleanup

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**Why nginx:alpine for AWS?** 
- Minimal attack surface for cloud security
- Faster ECR push/pull times (~23MB vs ~140MB)
- Lower data transfer costs
- Perfect for AWS Fargate if needed

The `.dockerignore` file ensures we don't bloat our image with unnecessary files:

```dockerignore
.git
.github
k8s
node_modules
*.md
Dockerfile
```

## Step 2: Amazon EKS Deployment

With our container ready for ECR, we create Kubernetes manifests optimized for Amazon EKS:

### Deployment with Resource Management
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: game-2048
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: game-2048
        image: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/game-2048:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "50m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

**EKS-specific optimizations:**
- **3 replicas** across multiple AZs for high availability
- **Resource limits** aligned with EKS node capacity
- **Health checks** integrated with ALB target groups
- **ECR image** with automatic vulnerability scanning

### AWS Load Balancer Integration
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: game-2048-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
spec:
  selector:
    app: game-2048
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

The service automatically provisions an AWS Network Load Balancer, providing:
- **High performance** with minimal latency
- **Static IP addresses** for DNS configuration
- **Cross-AZ load balancing** for fault tolerance

## Step 3: AWS-Integrated CI/CD Pipeline
![CI/CD Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HasanAshab/2048-game-devops/master/img/cicd.png)

The GitHub Actions workflow seamlessly integrates with AWS services for a complete deployment pipeline:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    - run: npm test

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - run: jshint js/*.js

  build:
    needs: [test, lint]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-east-1
    
    - name: Login to Amazon ECR
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2
    
    - uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        push: true
        tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
```

kind: Application
metadata:
  name: game-2048
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: game-2048-project
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/your-username/2048-game
    targetRevision: main
    path: k8s
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

### ArgoCD on EKS Benefits

### Multi-Environment Strategy

I created separate ArgoCD applications for different environments:

- **Production**: Deploys from `main` branch
- **Staging**: Deploys from `develop` branch with `staging-` prefix
- **Different namespaces** for isolation
- **Environment-specific configurations**

## Step 5: AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

The `./infra` directory provisions a complete AWS environment:

### Core AWS Resources
- **Amazon EKS cluster** with managed node groups
- **Amazon ECR repositories** with lifecycle policies
- **VPC and subnets** across multiple AZs
- **Security groups** with least-privilege access
- **IAM roles and policies** for service accounts

```hcl
# ECR Repository with scanning
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "game_2048" {
  name                 = "game-2048"
  image_tag_mutability = "MUTABLE"
  
  image_scanning_configuration {
    scan_on_push = true
  }
  
  lifecycle_policy {
    policy = jsonencode({
      rules = [{
        rulePriority = 1
        description  = "Keep last 10 images"
        selection = {
          tagStatus   = "any"
          countType   = "imageCountMoreThan"
          countNumber = 10
        }
        action = {
          type = "expire"
        }
      }]
    })
  }
}

# EKS Cluster
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "game_2048" {
  name     = "game-2048-cluster"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.eks_cluster.arn
  version  = "1.28"

  vpc_config {
    subnet_ids              = aws_subnet.private[*].id
    endpoint_private_access = true
    endpoint_public_access  = true
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Security Throughout
